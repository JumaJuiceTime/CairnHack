# Bronze & Sorcery

## Introduction

Within the Bloodless Moonâ€™s gaze civilization flourishes. The celestial sea is the cradle of mankind. Cities to empires prosper on its shores. Bronze gleams beautifully, as if a gift from the gods. Iron comes only from the heavens and speaks against the gods. Sinister cults and creatures of legend put your way of life at risk. You pick up your spear in daring challenge.

The Bloodless Moon's Gaze encompasses the domain of the white moon. The lands beyond are known as the moonless realms. A more accurate name would be the bloody realms, for the Blood Moon sees all. Adventures will feature Bronze, Moons, and Gods. 

## Bronze
**Bronze** is beautiful and _Iron_ is next to nonexistant, coming only from the stars. 

_Iron_ contains the will of the stars. Myths and cults revere this star iron. Some cherish sidereal fragments in secret, but the ostentatious flaunt weapons and idols of _Iron_. Any _Iron_ displayed will draw attention.

This is no bronze age analogue. 


## The Sea of Stars
Named for the frequent shooting stars that impact the sea. The Sea of Stars fosters the trade that allows the cities of its shores to flourish.
