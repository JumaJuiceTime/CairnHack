Bloodless Moon's Gaze is an adventure game about where bronze clad adventurers lock blades and seek mysteries in the bloodless moon's realm. Explore a world filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, adventures are tense and reward careful exploration, and combat is frantic and deadly.
