# White Dragon

16 HP, 1 Armor, 16 STR, 16 AGL, 12 PRS, bite (d12), _detachment_

- A massive winged creature of frost that lairs comfortably in only the coldest regions. 
- Perpetually accompanied by a storm of ice and wind, the White Dragon is a manifestation of winter itself.
- **Frost Breath**: Nearby targets must make a AGL save or are frozen solid, their breath turned to icicles in their lungs.
