# Mind Lasher

12 HP, 8 STR, 12 AGL, 18 PRS, tentacles (d6, _blast_)

- Humanoid creatures with purple skin and squid-like heads. Dwell deep underground or in spacefaring vessels. Feed on the brains of other humanoids, absorbing their memories and life essence. Highly intelligent, but evil beyond belief.
- **Mind Blast**: Nearby targets must save PRS or lose 1d4 PRS and become paralyzed.
- **Critical Damage**: A tentacle rips the victim's brain out of their skull.
