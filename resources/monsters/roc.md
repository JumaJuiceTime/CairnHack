# Roc

15 HP, 16 STR, 14 AGL, 12 PRS, beak (d12, _blast_), _detachment_

- Gargantuan birds of prey that roost in high plateau and distant mountain peaks. Powerful hunters, they will defend a clutch of eggs to the death.
- **Grab**: Their powerful talons can scoop up entire groups of people (targets must all make a AGL save to escape). Victims are carried back to the nest to be eaten alive.
- **Critical Damage**: Target is pierced through their middle, dying instantly.
